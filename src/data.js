            content: `The Hajj ( حَجّ‎ Ḥaǧǧ "pilgrimage") is an annual Islamic 
		pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the holiest city for
		 Muslims. It is a mandatory religious duty for Muslims that 
	 must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult 
	 Muslims who are physically and financially capable of undertaking 
	 the journey, and can support their family during their absence.

	 The literal meaning of the word Hajj is "heading to a place for the sake 
	 of visiting". In Islamic terminology, Hajj is a pilgrimage made to Kaaba, the
	  "House of Allah", in the sacred city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. The rites of Hajj 
	  are performed over five or six days, beginning on the eighth and ending on the thirteenth 
	  day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the last month of the Islamic calendar. It is one of the five pillars
	   of Islam, alongside Shahadah, Salat, Zakat and Sawm. The Hajj is the second largest annual 
	   gathering 
	   of Muslims in the world, after the Arba'een Pilgrimage in Karbala, Iraq. The state of being 
	   physically and financially capable of performing the Hajj is called istita'ah, and a Muslim 
	   who fulfills this condition is called a mustati. 
	   The Hajj is a demonstration of the solidarity of the Muslim people, 
	   and their submission to God (Allah).
		The word Hajj means "to attend a journey", which connotes both the outward act of a journey 
		and the inward act of intentions. 
	 Muslims may also undertake an Umrah ( عُمرَة‎), or "lesser pilgrimage" 
	 to Mecca at other times of the year. But this is not a substitute for the Hajj 
	 and Muslims are still obligated to perform the Hajj at some other point in their lifetime 
	 if they have the means to do so.`,

					under Muhammad's leadership, serving as the power base of Islam, and where Muhammad's Ummah (Community), 
					composed of both locals and immigrants from Muhammad's original home of Mecca, developed. Medina is home 
					to three prominent mosques, namely al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Quba Mosque, and Masjid al-Qiblatayn 
					('The mosque of the two Qiblas'). Muslims believe that the chronologically final surahs of the Quran 
					were revealed to 
					Muhammad in Medina, and are called Medinan surahs in contrast to the earlier Meccan surahs.`,

		 The stay at Muzdalifah is preceded by a day at Arafat, consisting of glorifying Allāh
		  (The God) repeating the Duʿāʾ (Supplication), repentance to Allah, and asking Him for 
		  forgiveness. At Arafat, Ẓuhr and ʿAṣr prayers are performed in a combined and abbreviated
		   form during the time of Zuhr. After sunset on the ninth day of the Islamic month of Dhūl-Ḥijjah,
			Muslim pilgrims travel to Muzdalifah, sometimes arriving at night because of over-crowding. 
			After arriving at Muzdalifah, pilgrims pray the Maghrib and ʿIshāʾ prayers jointly, whereas 
			the Isha prayer is shortened to 2 rakats. At Muzdalifah, pilgrims collect pebbles for the 
			Stoning of the Devil

		 reaches about 70 m (230 ft) in height, and is
		 also known as the "Mount of Mercy" (Arabic: جَبَل ٱلرَّحْمَة‎, romanized: Jabal Ar-Raḥmah)
		 . According to some Islamic tradition, the hill is the place where the Prophet 
		 Muhammad stood and delivered the Farewell Sermon to the Muslims who had accompanied him
		  for the Hajj towards the end of his life. Muslims also say that it is also the place where Adam 
		  and Hawa reunited on Earth after falling from Heaven, and where Adam was forgiven, hence it is 
		  known as the "Mount of Mercy". A pillar is erected to show the place where the aforementioned 
		  took place.

		On the 9th of the month of Dhu al-Hijjah pilgrims go to Arafat from Mina, for 
		the most important part of the Hajj. The Khutbah of Hajj is narrated and Zuhr
		 and Asr prayers are prayed together. The pilgrims spend the whole day on the
		  mountain to supplicate to Allah to forgive their sins and to pray for personal strength 
		  in the future. 
		  Arafat rituals end at sunset and pilgrims then move to Muzdalifah for Maghrib Prayer and a 
		  shortened Isha prayer and for a short rest.`,
